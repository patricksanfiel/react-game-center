##React Hangman
A hangman game made with React. Users can either enter a word for another player to guess or play on their own, pulling potential guess words at random from one of three API's([Dog CEO](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), [Rest Countries](http://restcountries.eu/), and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)). After each incorrect guess, the canvas element will update, adding another body part to the hangman. Guess the word and you win, but get enough incorrect guesses to draw the whole hangman and its game over. Check out a live demo [here](https://patricksanfiel.github.io/react-hangman/).
